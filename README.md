===============

During the working with Go I was inspired to create a similiar functionality in C because everybody rejects the working 
with C and lots of people think C is to low and nobody need it to go down but in my opinion only in programming with C you get the feeling
and knowledge how a language internally works. 
IÂ´m not a professional C programmer but I like it and I will do everything to become one.
